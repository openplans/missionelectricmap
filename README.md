Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. 

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts.png)](http://travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts)

Shareabouts is intended to be customized. For example, you could use it to collect public input on suitable locations for stations in a city-wide bike share.

The project is open source, and we welcome your involvement.

Requirements and a setup guide are located at the [Shareabouts wiki](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/wiki).
